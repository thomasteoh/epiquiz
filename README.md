# epiquiz - Shiny app to generate a quiz from Google forms input

A short script in Shiny and R to create a web-accessible application, that takes data as stored in a publicly available Google Sheets file online and presents it as in a flash cards interface, organised into Themes, Questions, Answers (hide/show). As data is stored remotely in Google Sheets, and entries are able to be created using a system such as Google Forms, this is a low-maintenance way of presenting information that is able to be safely stored in the Google cloud ecosystem.

Shiny theming by default is based on bootstrap, so bootstrap themes should work out of the box. 

Themes as described on the Shiny webpage:
